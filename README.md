What this project is about
This repository showcases a complete, end-to-end iOS 26 chat app that leverages the FoundationModels framework to run LLMs directly on the device. It highlights several important capabilities:
- On-device large language models (LLMs) that never leave the user‚Äôs device.
- Tool calling to extend the LLM with native iOS capabilities.
- EventKit integration to create, read, and manage calendar events by natural language.
- Privacy-first AI that minimizes data movement and emphasizes user consent and transparency.

Core concepts
- On-device AI: The app loads a lightweight foundation model on the device and performs inference locally. No cloud dependency is required for core chat features.
- FoundationModels framework: A family of on-device AI tools that enable natural language understanding, reasoning, and lightweight generation within the sandboxed app.
- Tool calling: The LLM can call native tools to perform tasks such as calendar operations, reminder scheduling, and data lookup. The app exposes a clean interface for tool handlers and safety checks.
- EventKit integration: The app can translate user intent into calendar actions, create events, and modify schedules while respecting user privacy and permissions.
- MVVM and SwiftUI: The app uses a clear MVVM architecture with SwiftUI for UI. State is predictable, testable, and easy to extend.
- Privacy-first: Data is processed on-device whenever possible. Network access is minimized, and user consent is central to any data-sharing behavior.

On-device AI with FoundationModels
- Local inference: The app loads a foundation model on the device and runs inference without sending user data to a server.
- Lightweight prompts: Interaction uses concise prompts and streaming responses where supported to provide a responsive experience.
- Model selection: The app can be configured to use different on-device models depending on device capabilities and user preferences.
- Safety boundaries: All model outputs pass through a safety layer to filter unsafe or harmful content. Tool calls are validated before execution.

Tool calling and plugins
- Tool registry: The app defines a set of tools it can call, such as calendar creation, event search, and local data access.
- Prompt design: The LLM is guided to call tools when a task benefits from it, for example creating a calendar event from natural language.
- Execution pipeline: A safe execution pipeline ensures only approved tools and parameters are used.
- Error handling: The app gracefully handles tool failures, including user-facing error messages and easy retry options.

EventKit integration
- Calendar access: The app uses EventKit to read and write calendar data, with appropriate user permissions.
- Event creation: Users can ask the assistant to create events, reminders, or appointments. The app translates these requests into EventKit objects.
- Conflict handling: The app detects scheduling conflicts and offers alternatives or prompts for user input.
- Privacy controls: Calendar data remains in the device‚Äôs sandbox. If you enable sync or cloud-based features, only explicit user consent will trigger data transfer.

Privacy and security
- Data locality: Personal data stays on-device whenever possible. Network calls, if any, are minimized and encrypted.
- Permissions: The app clearly explains why each permission is needed, and users can revoke permissions at any time.
- Encryption: Sensitive data stored on the device is encrypted using system-provided mechanisms.
- Auditing: Actions taken by the user and the assistant are logged locally for debugging and user transparency.
- Compliance: The design aligns with common privacy expectations for on-device AI and calendar data usage.

Architecture and patterns
- MVVM: The app follows a clean separation of concerns. Views bind to view models, which orchestrate data flow and business logic.
- SwiftUI: The UI is built with SwiftUI for rapid development and a responsive user experience.
- Dependency injection: The project uses DI to decouple components, making the app easier to test and extend.
- Modularity: Core AI logic is separated from the UI, enabling reuse in other apps or prototypes.
- Testing strategy: Unit tests cover models and view models; UI tests verify user flows around chat, tool calls, and calendar interactions.

User experience and UI
- Chat-first UI: A familiar chat interface allows users to converse with the on-device AI assistant.
- Tool prompts: The assistant can ask for permission or clarification before invoking a tool.
- Calendar-aware conversations: The assistant can propose events, check dates, and adjust times with natural language.
- Accessibility: UI elements are labeled for screen readers, with scalable text support and high-contrast options.
- Localization: The app includes support for multiple languages to reach a broader audience.

Accessibility and localization
- Dynamic type and font size: The UI respects user font size preferences for readability.
- VoiceOver support: All interactive elements are accessible and properly labeled.
- Localizable strings: Text content is extracted for translation, with fallbacks if translations are missing.
- Cultural considerations: The app avoids culturally sensitive content and uses neutral language in prompts and messages.

Performance and power considerations
- Battery-aware inference: On-device models are optimized for energy efficiency. Inference load is managed to keep battery impact reasonable.
- Memory usage: The app loads models and caches prompts efficiently to minimize RAM consumption.
- Responsiveness: The UI remains interactive even while the model is computing results, using streaming responses where supported.

Development workflow
- Branching strategy: Use feature branches for new capabilities (e.g., feature/calendar-tool, feature-privacy-hardening).
- Code quality: Follow the repository‚Äôs coding standards. Run linters and formatters as part of your workflow.
- Continuous integration: If CI is set up, ensure builds pass for both iOS devices and simulators.
- Documentation: Update README and inline code comments as you add features. Keep the doc synced with the code.

Testing and debugging
- Unit tests: Test models, prompts, and view models independently.
- UI tests: Validate common user flows like starting a chat, asking for a calendar action, and handling permission prompts.
- Logging: Use lightweight, privacy-aware logging to diagnose issues without exposing user data.
- Debug builds: Create a debug flag to enable verbose logs and mock tools during development.

Examples and use cases
- Natural language calendar management: ‚ÄúSchedule a meeting with Alex next Friday at 3 PM and invite Jamie.‚Äù
- Reminder automation: ‚ÄúRemind me to call the client after lunch tomorrow.‚Äù
- Knowledge queries: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my next upcoming event that conflicts with a project deadline?‚Äù
- Local data retrieval: ‚ÄúShow me all events I created last week.‚Äù

Troubleshooting
- If the app cannot access the calendar, ensure you granted calendar permissions in Settings. The app will request permission at first use and clearly communicate why it needs access.
- If on-device inference fails to start, verify device compatibility and the chosen model. Some models require more memory or CPU capacity, so a lower-demand option may be necessary on older devices.
- If tool calls fail, check that the tool registry is properly configured and that the user‚Äôs intent is understood. Debug logs can help you identify mismatch in prompts or missing tool handlers.

Code quality and style
- Use clear naming for models, prompts, and tools to reduce ambiguity.
- Keep prompt engineering modular and testable.
- Document complex prompts with examples to help future contributors understand intended behavior.
- Maintain a consistent UI style aligned with iOS design guidelines.

Security considerations
- Minimize data exposure: keep most data on-device and only share information with explicit user consent if necessary.
- Clear permissions: explain why the app needs each permission and how it uses the data.
- Safe tool execution: enforce strict input validation and sandboxed tool calls to prevent unexpected behavior.
